## Introduction
This machine learning model is designed to predict house prices using a dataset of historical housing data. It's a regression problem, and the model is trained to estimate the price of a house based on its various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, etc.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use this model, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found in the `data` directory. The dataset is typically divided into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

## Usage
You can use the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository to train the model and make predictions. Open the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment and follow the step-by-step instructions.

```bash
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on various regression metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. You can check the evaluation results in the Jupyter Notebook.
